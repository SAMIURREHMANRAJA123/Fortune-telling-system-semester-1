The Fortune Telling System is a console-based application developed in C++. This project leverages user inputs such as date of birth, name, and gender to generate personalized horoscopes and
predict various aspects of the userâ€™s future. The system provides insights into health, relationships, lucky numbers, birthstones, and more, based on astrological configurations. It also
includes features like calculating love percentages between two individuals based on their names. This project showcases my skills in object-oriented programming, data structures, and 
algorithm development, and is a fun way to explore the intersection of technology and astrology.
